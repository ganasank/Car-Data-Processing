# Car-Data-Processing
Data Processing for EMG, IMU, Zephyr, EDA for Car Study  
  
    
Final_Code_Resample_Working.ipynb is for resampling IMU data and storing them in sheets for F&F2 - for Stressed and Relaxed controleld environments  
IMU_Data Processing.ipynb takes in the resampled code and computs various stats and stores them in excel files along with plots  
Min Time Calculation.ipynb is for Minimum Time among stressed and relaxed phase for each participant in IMU  
  
    
PSD_MPF.ipynb and PSD_MPF-Spect.ipynb are for getting PSD and Spectrogram from IMU data  
  
    
EMG_Preprocessing.ipynb is for preprocessing the EMG file to extract necessary portions for stressed and unstressed conditions in F&F2  
EMG_Analysis_Of_Processed_Files.ipynb is for analysis of processed EMG data  
  
    
SOTR_File_Cleaning.ipynb is for reading the files from Stress on the road experiment, and saving all the files in one location - with time synced to video and original files in similar table formats
